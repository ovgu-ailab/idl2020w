# Reading Assignment: Introspection - Part I

Start with [this overview blog post](https://distill.pub/2017/feature-visualization/)
and a [more recent addition](https://distill.pub/2018/building-blocks/).

Now it's time to look at some specific techniques. Dig as deep as you like! These websites (and papers) provide plenty of background information.

1. [Deepvis](http://yosinski.com/deepvis)
	(code and paper are linked, optional further reading on [fooling neural nets](http://www.evolvingai.org/fooling))

2. [LSTMVis](http://lstm.seas.harvard.edu/)
	(code and paper are linked)

3. [exBert - Visual Analysis of Transformer Models](https://exbert.net)

4. [Heatmapping](http://heatmapping.org/) - especially [Methods for Interpreting and Understanding Deep Neural Networks (2017), Montavon et al.](https://arxiv.org/abs/1706.07979)

About implementation: To easily apply introspection techniques to your TF/Keras models, you can give [tf-explain](https://www.sicara.ai/blog/2019-08-28-interpretability-deep-learning-tensorflow) a try.
(It currently only works on image data)
